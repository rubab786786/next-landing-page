                      We started in 2019 with a radical idea that Small and
                      Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs) could raise capital from crowd
                      funders. Our far-reaching vision is to become a leading platform
                      that supports SMBâ€™s growth throughout Decentralized Finance
                      (DeFi) and assets tokenization where investors can expect steady
                      returns and rewards.
